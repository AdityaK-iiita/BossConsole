/**
 * The key-routing policy: **the host keymap wins, and the plugin gets what is left.**
 *
 * #34 deferred `key` emission for want of exactly this decision. The risk it was guarding against is
 * specific — an out-of-process plugin that can swallow `Cmd+W` traps the user in a panel it also
 * controls — so these tests are about what is *refused* at least as much as what is delivered.
 *
 * Three separate things make a host shortcut safe, and this file asserts the two that are decidable
 * without AWT:
 *
 * 1. `AWTKeyboardInterceptor` consumes claimed keys at the `KeyboardFocusManager`, upstream of Compose
 *    entirely — structural, and not something a unit test can meaningfully re-check.
 * 2. The forwarding rule refuses anything the live keymap binds, so the guarantee does not rest on
 *    dispatch order alone. **Here.**
 * 3. The tap never consumes — asserted in [RemoteSurfaceInputComposeTest], against a real composition,
 *    since "the key carried on past the surface" is a statement about a modifier chain.
 *
 * Events are built with Compose's own `KeyEvent(...)` factory, which is `@InternalComposeUiApi`. The
 * alternative — driving keys through a composition — is what [RemoteSurfaceInputComposeTest] does; what
 * is wanted *here* is to sweep the whole shipped preset in one cheap pass, which needs synthetic events.
 * If a Compose upgrade removes the factory this fails to compile, which is the right failure.
